## Project Overview

This repository contains my work for the **CognoRise Infotech Machine Learning Internship**. The focus is on implementing and analyzing machine learning solutions for a variety of tasks. Each task represents a distinct machine learning problem, using publicly available datasets to build and evaluate predictive models.

---

## Project Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with machine learning techniques.
- Implement and document solutions for eight real-world tasks.
- Learn and apply different algorithms to solve classification, regression, and recommendation problems.
- Present my work on GitHub and LinkedIn for enhanced learning and visibility.
